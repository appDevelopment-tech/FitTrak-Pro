## Overall Assessment

⚠️ **CRITICAL BUG FOUND**

**The Problem:**
All students display "NaN лет" (NaN years) instead of their actual age. This is caused by invalid date handling in the age calculation function.

**Impact:**
- ✅ CREATE works (students can be added)
- ❌ READ is blocked (cannot select students from list)
- ❌ UPDATE is blocked (cannot access edit functionality)
- ❌ DELETE is blocked (cannot access delete functionality)

**Root Cause:**
File: `/client/src/components/students/comprehensive-students-management.tsx` (Lines 206-221)

The code doesn't validate `pupil.birthDate` before using it:
```typescript
const birthDate = new Date(pupil.birthDate);  // Invalid dates return NaN
const age = today.getFullYear() - birthDate.getFullYear();  // NaN - number = NaN
```

**The Fix:**
Add date validation:
```typescript
if (!pupil.birthDate || isNaN(new Date(pupil.birthDate).getTime())) {
  return { ...pupil, age: 0, isMinor: false };
}
```

## Test Evidence

### Successful Operations:
1. ✅ Login works
2. ✅ Navigation to Students section works
3. ✅ "Add Student" dialog opens
4. ✅ Form accepts all required fields
5. ✅ Student creation succeeds (count increased 5→6)

### Failed Operations:
1. ❌ Student list displays "NaN лет" for ALL students
2. ❌ Cannot click on students (names not visible)
3. ❌ Cannot view student details
4. ❌ Cannot edit students
5. ❌ Cannot delete students

---

## Recommendation

**Priority: CRITICAL - Fix immediately**

This bug blocks 80% of the Students section functionality. Fix the age calculation validation, then re-run tests to verify full CRUD operations.

**Estimated fix time:** 30 minutes
**Re-test time:** 10 minutes
